Bug will be fixed without breaking the API        for <em>at least two years</em>, probably a lot longer.        Some modules development will be continued and will still be enhanced the API without breaking.  </blockquote>    <p>      I have been developing and using javascript database library (YDN-DB) for      nearly three years and now it is time to release. This is the time with multiple reasons. </p>    <p>      First of all, I like <a title="YDN-DB API" href="http://dev.yathit.com/api-reference/ydn-db/storage.html">the        API</a> a lot. There are few I want to change,      but I cannot figure out significantly better alternative. As you can see,      API is very simple. Just instantiate the main class (<code>ydn.db.Storage</code>)      and start using right aways. It works on all browsers and mobile clients.      API is very concise, meaning you don't need to learn much, but use right aways. Expected      methods like <code>add</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>put</code> and <code>clear</code>      are there and works as expected. </p>    <p>      At the same time, the API is very flexible and powerfull enough on very      complex situation requiring transactions and multiple nested queries. I have      being using the library to many large scale projects. Many other people      are also using my library for large scale projects. </p>    <p>      Performance is considered from the ground up as      well as every piece of implementation. There is no caching to make it run      faster. High performance is archived by using parallelization of database      executions and using raw browser API as much as possible. </p>    <p>      I apologize that my library is not working perfectly on some browsers like      IE and on mobiles. The library works well on Chrome and Firefox. The main      reason is that other browsers do not yet follow IndexedDB API      specification. They can be polyfilled, but does so require a lot of      testing and implementation. These missing API are for advanced use cases      (multiEntry, compound index), but they are not easy to implement. So I      will just wait, rather than trying to polyfill them. </p>    <p>      Event module is incomplete. Implementing event is      hard and also there is performance penalty. The use case are often, more of      convenient than essential. IndexedDB API v2 is likely to have native      support for Event. So, event module implementation need to wait and I may      not fix bugs on this module. </p>    <h3>      Version 2 is coming </h3>    <p>      Version 2 API focus on robustness, trading over ease of use. It is not      backward compatible. Only IndexedDB will be supported and use native      object like <code><a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#promises">Promise</a></code>, <code>        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#range-concept">IDKeyRange</a></code> and <code>        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#cursor-concept">IDBCussor</a></code>.        It will be less reliance on <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/library/">closure library</a> or      possibly not using it at all. </p>    <p>I have proposed few API methods to W3 web app working group on <a href="https://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/IndexedDatabaseFeatures">        IndexedDB API v2 specification</a>. Most of these API methods are required for efficient key joining and query        optimizations. The proposed methods are very likely to appear on v2. Of course, YDN-DB will be the first to support them        and will be back port to v1 as well.</p>    <p>      Main concept like schema, <a href="http://dev.yathit.com/ydn-db/transaction.html">transaction thread</a> and iterator style query will be      carried forward. Most of the implementation will be focused on <a href="http://dev.yathit.com/ydn-db/sql-query.html">SQL      execution</a>. <a href="http://dev.yathit.com/ydn-db/synchronization.html">Synchronization</a> with backend services and        <a href="https://github.com/yathit/ydn-db-fulltext">full text search</a> will      work out of the box. </p>    <p>      Another main reason is, W3 web app working group has published release      candidate for <a title="Indexed Database API" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB">IndexedDB        API v1</a> several months ago with consensus agreement with browser      vendor except Apple. So I hope all browsers will implement IndexedDB API      with strict compatibility. </p>    <p>      Last reason is that today is my last day of work at National University of      Singapore. </p>    </article>    <script type="text/javascript">initDom()</script>  </body></html>
